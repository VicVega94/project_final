    <th> 60's<br>
    The 1960's fashion had become an explosion of color that seemed bottled up from the 50's. Just ten years prior the style
    was a completly different tone with the fashion being very much conservative compared to it's 60's older brother. The 60's saw the
    emergence of minishirts, colorful tights and men in tunics. Iconic figures like Jackie Kennedy, Twiggy and
    Mary Quant helped shape the standard of class and style in the 60's. Listed are a few pivotol desingers for this decade.
    <ul>
      <li> Coco Chanel </li>
      <li> Mary Quant </li>
      <li> Givenchy </li>
      </ul>

    <th>70's<br>
    The 1970's brought some of the most recognizable pieces of clothing that to this day are still in style. From flares, bell sleeves,
    mini skirts, etc the 70's had definetly been 10 years of eceltic style. The 70's brought such a bold style that celebrties such
    as Cher, David Bowie and Bianca Jagger could thrive with their relams of expressive freedom. The style of this decade has yet to
    be reached by any other decade. Listed are a few pivitol designers for this decade.
    <ul>
      <li> Bob Mackie</li>
      <li> Patrizia Von Brandenstein</li>
      <li>Yves Saint Laurent</li>
    </ul>
</th>
    <th>80's<br>
    There is not much to say about a decade that has been probably one of the most famous for it's iconic trends that have such
    a hold on the fahsion industry. The 1980's came big with power suits, shoulder pads, big hair and oversized blazers. This decade showcased
    some of the most recognizable outfits from style icons such as Madonna, Michael Jackson and Princess Diana. Listed are a few pivitol
    designers for this decade.
    <ul>
      <li> Deborah Nadoolman Landis</li>
      <li> Elizabeth Emanuel </li>
      <li> Jean Paul Gaultier </li>

  <tr>
    <th>90's<br>
      To me it's not fully correct to say that 90's fashion has passed because to this current day we can see different aspects of
      a style from 21 years ago still prevalent. The direction the 1990's took completly changed the standard of fashion with the 90's
      bringing more of a casual, relaxed grunge style. To combat that we also witnessed catwalks with models sporting the worlds most luxurious
      designers, some of which are listed below.
      <ul>
        <li> Gianni Versace</li>
        <li> Jean Paul Gaultier </li>
        <li> Deborah Lynn Scott </li>
      </th>

    <th>00's<br>
    The new millenium had arrived and now fashion has arrived to your front door. The 2000's brought low rise jeans, trucker hats and juicy
    sweat pants onto the red carpet. Just like the 90's while the style was very attainable and relaxed it was also coined with luxurious
    designers that even would go on to help create an every day tool we use to this day. Some of the pivitol desingers are listed below.
    <ul>
      <li> Gianni Versace</li>
      <li> Mona May</li>
      <li> Ed Hardy </li>

    <th>10's <br>
    The most recent of our memories will go to what we saw on the tv and how it made us all react. The trend of everday style that had
    held the 90's and 2000's started to lose it's grip on the fashion industry. Clothing on the red carpets started to see a reemergence
    of high end fashion coming from designers who were putting out once again innovate statements with their designs.
    <ul>
      <li> Clare Waight Keller </li>
      <li> Adam Selman </li>
      <li> Franc Fernandez </li>
