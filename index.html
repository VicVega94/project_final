    Hello all, welcome to my page. Here my main goal is to provide more insight into some of the most famous fashions in media history.
    As well as provide more information on the years that provided us these fashions and the designers that gave us their art. I hope with what I
  was able to put here will teach something that wasn't known before. Fashion alot of time is swept under the rug as just clothing but
not alot of people understand that these "clothes" have cemented themselves in our minds forever. </p>
